## About
I am a software engineer currently working in Accenture. A few months back I came accross the terms Machine Learning and Data Science. 
Since then I have invested a lot of time learning and implementing the concepts of Data Science and Machine learning. You can take a look at my [github](https://github.com/jinudaniel) profile to know more about the projects worked on.
